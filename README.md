FEAST
-----------------------

FEAST is an efficient Expectation-Maximization-based method to identify the sources and proportions of contamination in marker-gene and functional metagenomic studies. FEAST is available in R and Python. The data supported by FEAST must come in a file wherein the sources are rows, and the columns are OTU counts. The number of distinct OTUs should be equal for the both the sources and the sink.


Software Requirements:
-----------------------

- R version 3.4.4 


FEAST in R (rFEAST)
-----------------------

rFEAST uses the following dependencies : "doParallel", "foreach", "mgcv", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "philentropy", "MCMCpack", "lsei", "Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo" and "cowplot".
