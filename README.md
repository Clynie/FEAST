pyFEAST â€” FEAST in Python 2.7

FEAST is an expectation maximization algorithm to identify quantify sources of bacterial contamination in a sample. pyFEAST is currently in beta, and this implementation is used solely for simulations. The data supported by pyFEAST must come in a file wherein the sources are rows, and the columns are OTU counts. The number of distinct OTUs should be equal for the both the sources and the sink. You can use the current code to run your own simulations, or modify the simulated sink to a real sink. pyFEAST mainly uses numpy and achieves faster performance than its R counterpart. The main difference between the R and python implementations of FEAST is that the R version initializes the mixing proportions of the EM algorithm using a solution to constrained least squares, and pyFEAST uses a solution from non-negative least squares. To our current knowledge, this does not cause differences in EM estimations.
